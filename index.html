      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>So, how did I end up here?</p>
      <p>I was a Computer Science & Drama double major once upon a time. A unique pairing whose primary use was making people go "Well that's interesting" for the next nine years. Following college, I taught. 
        I was a high school math teacher for the NYC Department of Education; a decision not a single one of my fellow CS majors shared with me.
      </p>
      <p>Towards the end of my teaching career, I started furiously and obsessively coding once again. I was in charge of all things technical
        and making every possible Google spreadsheet the school could think of, so I was never truly out of practice, but the function flame was only truly reignited after a little game 
      called Wordle made an appearance. </p>
      <p>
        As someone who loves puzzles, I embarked a new puzzle: what is the best possible starting word in a game like Wordle? I was 
        by no means the first person to ask or even answer this question, but that didn't stop me. I didn't rest until I had arrived at the answer myself. 
        I kept pushing my code to its limits until I managed the lowest average possible. When that happened, I found ways to keep going. I worked on modifying my code so 
        it would work for nearly every Wordle variant I could find. I shared my creation to an online audience that has reached millions of people. And I did all of this by myself, five years 
        out of a CS degree, without even using a single framework outside of vanilla javascript and jquery (mostly because at the time I didn't know anything else). 
      </p>
      <p>All this to say, there isn't much I can't teach myself how to do, given enough time and hyperfixation. I have several ideas on what I'd like my next obsession to be, but if you have something in mind, please, let me know. 
        You'd be hard pressed to give me something I wouldn't try.
