<title> Yuval Ben-Hayun's Bio </title></head>

<body>
<p> To whom it may concern, <br><br>
  <span class = "bio"> My name is Yuval Ben-Hayun and I am currently a sophomore at Tufts Unviversity pusuing a double major in mathematics and computer science. My interest in math started at a young age, but it was not until my freshman year of college that I found a strong liking towards computer science. In many respects, computer programming reminds me of a massive puzzle. It's a logic driven process, with a precise solution. Once that solution is reached, all the effort aimed towards creating code becomes immediately satisfactory. The puzzle is solved and the goal is attained. Beyond my academic passions, I am involved in performing arts, am a university tour guide, and dance with a highly competitive step team. Thank you for visitng my website and I look forward to discussing future opportunies. </span><br><br></p>
