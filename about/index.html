      <h3> About Me </h3>
      <p> My name is Yuval Ben-Hayun. I am 19 years old, and I am a sophomore at Tufts University, in Medford Massachusetts. <br><br>
        I'm double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a possible minor in Drama, and expect to graduate in 2017. <br><br>

        As a CS major, I obviously love to code. However, as a math major, the logic and puzzles that lie in the more abstracted areas of CS are what interests me the most. I'm also researching further into creating desirable user interfaces, graphic design, and game development. <br><br>

        Outside of my academics, I'm an admissions tour guide, I volunteer at the Bright Horizon Daycare, am a member of a highly competitive step team, participate in a number of student theatre productions at Tufts, and can be found playing a multitude of video games in my nonexistent free time. <br><br>
        If you are interested in reaching out to me, feel free to <a href = "mailto:ybenhayun@gmail.com"> email me</a>.</p>
