      <h3> About Me </h3>
      <p> My name is Yuval Ben-Hayun. I am 19 years old, and I am a sophomore at Tufts University, in Medford Massachusetts. <br><br>
        I'm double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a possible minor in Drama. I expect to graduate in 2017. <br><br>

        As a CS major, I obviously love to code. However, as a math major, the logic and puzzles that lie in the more abstracted areas of CS are what interests me the most. I'm also researching further into creating desirable user interfaces, graphic design, and game development. <br><br>

        Outside of my academics, I've participated in the three student theatre groups on the Tufts campus: 3P's, Torn Ticket II, and Bare Bodkin. Through those groups I've acted, directed, and most recently tried my hand at producing.  I also volunteer at the Bright Horizons Day Care, am an admissions tour guide, and dance with a highly competitive step team, <a href = "https://twitter.com/blackoutstep">BlackOut</a>.<br><br>

        For the time being, I'm currently cast in Tufts' Department of Drama's winter production, "Is He Dead?" and I'm producing Bare Bodkin's production of "Dr. Faustus" in the Spring.<br><br>

        Outside of extracurriculars and schoolwork, I love to ski, run, read comics, and can be found playing a multitude of video games in my nonexistent free time (although recently I've looked into actually creating them). I also try to help my right-brained friends and classmates with any of their Math & CS woes. <br><br>

        I'm looking for opportunities primarily in creating desirable web interfaces, and game development/design. Although, I'm interested in many facets of CS, including programing, debugging, and tutoring.<br><br>
