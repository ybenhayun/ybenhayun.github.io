      <h3> About Me </h3>
      <p> My name is Yuval Ben-Hayun. I am 19 years old, and I am a sophomore at Tufts University, in Medford Massachusetts. <br><br>
        I'm double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a possible minor in Drama. I expect to graduate in 2017. <br><br>

        As a CS major, I obviously love to code. However, as a math major, the logic and puzzles that lie in the more abstracted areas of CS are what interests me the most. Through my Math & CS interests, I'm currently researching further into creating desirable user interfaces, graphic design, and game development. <br><br>

        Outside of my academics, I've participated in the three student theatre groups on the Tufts campus: <a href = "http://www.tufts3ps.com/" target = "_blank">3P's</a>, <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/tornticketii" target = "_blank">Torn Ticket II</a>, and <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bare-Bodkin-Theatre-Company/163723620400553" target = "_blank">Bare Bodkin</a>. Through those groups I've acted, directed, and most recently tried my hand at producing.  I also volunteer at the Bright Horizons Day Care, am an admissions tour guide, and dance with a highly competitive step team, <a href = "https://twitter.com/blackoutstep" target = "_blank">BlackOut</a>.<br><br>

        For the time being, I'm currently cast in Tufts' Department of Drama's winter production, "Is He Dead?" and I'm producing Bare Bodkin's production of "Dr. Faustus" in the Spring.<br><br>

        Outside of extracurriculars and schoolwork, I love to ski, run, read comics, and can be found playing a multitude of video games in my nonexistent free time (although recently I've looked into actually creating them). I also try to help my right-brained friends and classmates with any of their Math & CS woes. <br><br>

        Right now, I've been focusing on UI and game development/design. Although, I'm interested in many facets of CS, including discovering algorithms, security, and tutoring.<br><br>
