    <h3>Project Euler Solutions Guide</h3>
    <p class = "euler">Recently, I've decided to keep track of the 
      problems I've solved from <a href = "https://projecteuler.net" 
      target = "_blank">projecteuler.net</a>, and post the steps to the 
      solutions here. Currently, I've solved 23 problems.</p>
    <div class = "euler">
      <li class = "prob">Problem #1) Multiples of 3 and 5 <a class = "1"
        >(more)</a></li><hr>
      <div class = "1"><strong>Problem: </strong> If we list all the 
        natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 
        3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum 
        of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.<br><br>
      <strong>Solution: </strong>The answer to this problem can be 
      accomplished through a simple while/for loop. Set an integer 
      equal to 3, and progressively add 3 to the integer. This number 
      will clearly be divisible by either 3 or 5, so add it to the sum. 
      Like this:<br>
      <div class = "code"><code>int i = first; <br>while (i < range){ <div class = "indent"> sum += i;<br>i += first;</div> } </code></div>
      Then repeat the process, but start with 5. This time, make sure 
      the number isn't divisible by 3 (by using mod), that way you 
      don't have duplicates.
      <div class = "code"><code> i = second; <br> while (i < range){<div
       class = "indent">if (i%first != 0)<div class = "indent">
      sum += i;</div>i += second;</div>}</code></div>
      Not at all a difficult problem. You can find the source code <a 
      href = https://github.com/ybenhayun/Project_Euler/blob/master/%231
      -threeFive/threeFive.cpp class = "code" target = "_blank">here</a>
      .

      <li class = "prob">Problem #2) Even Fibonacci Numbers <a class = "
        2">(more)</a></li><hr>
      <div class = "2"><strong>Problem: </strong>Each new term in the 
        Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms
        . By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: <br><br>
        1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...<br><br>By considering 
        the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 
        four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.<br><br>
        <strong>Solution: </strong>Fibonacci numbers are defined by the 
        sum of the last two fibonacci numbers. By using a temp variable 
        and while loop, you can calculate all of the Fibonacci numbers 
        under a certain value. Like this:
        <div class = "code"><code> while (n < range){ <div class = "
          indent">int tempn = n; <br>n += i; <br>i = tempn;<br> if ((
          n%2 == 0)&&(n < range)) <div class = "indent">sum += n;</div></div>}</code></div> 
        With i and n being set to 1. At the completion of the loop, you 
        will have the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers under the given 
        range. You can find the source code <a href = https://github.com
        /ybenhayun/Project_Euler/blob/master/%232-evenFibonacciNumbers/
        evenFibonacciNumbers.cpp class = "code" target = "_blank"> here</a>.
