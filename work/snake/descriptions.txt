<span id = 'inst'><br>Use the arrows keys to move around the grid. Collect as many fruit as you can without hitting yourself (walls are ok). Good luck!</span>
No tricks here. This is the same classic game you played on your Nokia cell phone.</span>
This little snake loves fruit, but he seems to leave some nasty things behind as he slithers around...</span>
Look, differentiating colors can be tough for some of us. And for sometime that can kill you.</span>
You might think that the title of this game means your snake has really good eyesight. You'd be wrong.</span>
I really hope you're not claustrophobic.</span>
You want a really long snake? Well, here you go.</span>
This snake doesn't mind chasing after the food he wants. And the food isn't going to stop moving anytime soon.</span>
This snake is years ahead of its time, and perfectly capable of bending time and space at will.</span>
If you can pick up your fruit quickly, this game will be a breeze. Otherwise...</span>
I hope you have a good memory...</span>
He can't hurt you, but he can make your life difficult. He may be slow, but don't assume you're faster.</span>
Hope you were practicing in gym class.</span>
Keep an eye out for traffic.</span>
Good luck making sense of this one. </span>
I hope your snake is wearing some body armor, because otherwise, you may run out of space. </span>
This is the end... sorry.</span>
