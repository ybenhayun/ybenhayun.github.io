No tricks here. This is the same classic game you played on your Nokia cell phone.</span>
This little snake loves fruit, but he seems to leave some nasty things behind as he slithers around...</span>
This guy loves to eat so much, that sometimes he forgets what he should and shouldn't be putting into his mouth.</span>
You might think that the title of this game means your snake has really good eyesight. You'd be wrong.</span>
I really hope you're not claustrophobic.</span>
You want a really long snake? Well, here you go.</span>
This snake doesn't mind chasing after the food he wants. And the food isn't going to stop moving anytime soon.</span>
This snake is years ahead of its time, and perfectly capable of bending time and space at will!</span>
If you can pick up your fruit quickly, this game will be a breeze. Otherwise...</span>
I hope you have a good memory...</span>
Ghosty Ghosty oOOooOoO</span>
If you can dodge a bomb, you can dodge a ball.</span>
Keep an eye out for traffic.</span>
Good luck making sense of this one. </span>
I hope your snake is wearing some body armor. </span>
This is the end... sorry.</span>
