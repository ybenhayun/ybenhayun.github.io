This is SNAKE, with 15 alternate versions. Take a look! Use the arrows keys to move around the grid. Collect as many fruit as you can without hitting yourself (walls are ok). Good luck!
No tricks here. This is the same classic game you played on your Nokia cell phone.
This little snake loves fruit, but he seems to leave some nasty things behind as he slithers around...
Look, telling colors apart can be tough for some of us. And sometimes that can kill you.
You might think that the title of this game means your snake has really good eyesight. You'd be wrong.
I really hope you're not claustrophobic.
You want a really long snake? Well, here you go.
This snake doesn't mind chasing after the food he wants. And the food isn't going to stop moving anytime soon.
This snake is years ahead of its time, and perfectly capable of bending time and space at will.
If you can pick up your fruit quickly, this game will be a breeze. Otherwise...
I hope you have a good memory...
He can't hurt you, but he can make your life difficult. He may be slow, but don't assume you're faster.
Hope you were practicing in gym class.
Keep an eye out for traffic.
Good luck making sense of this one. 
I hope your snake is wearing some body armor, because otherwise, you may run out of space. 
This is the end... sorry.
