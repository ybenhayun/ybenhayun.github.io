    <p> Currently, you can find my most of my relevant projects, including schoolwork, <a href = https://projecteuler.net/about target = "_blank">Project Euler</a>, and recreational programs, on my <a href = https://github.com/ybenhayun target = "_blank">Github</a> profile. </p>
    <h4 class = "snake"> Snake! - A Modification </h4>
    <p><div class = "indent"><a href = "https://ybenhayun.github.io/work/snake" target = "_blank"> https://ybenhayun.github.io/work/snake </a><br>This project is based off of the old game of the same name. Whilst playing said game, I started to think about more creative modifications I could make to the game. So, I made a snake game which (as of right now) has ten different variations. It's still very much a work in progress, but feel free to take a look at what I have so far! <hr></div></p>
    <h4 class = "euler"> Project Euler Solutions Guide </h4>
    <p><div class = "indent"><a href = "https://ybenhayun.github.io/blog" target = "_blank"> https://ybenhayun.github.io/work/blog </a><br> Project Euler is a lot of fun for anyone who enjoys mathematics and CS. Take a look at the blog tab for more information on this endeavor.<hr></div></p>
