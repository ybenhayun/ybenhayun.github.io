<h4>Snake! </h4>
    <p class = "snake">My most recent project started when I was playing a game of snake (the one from your old Nokia cell phone). Snake's a great game, and it's pretty cool to see your snake grow into infinity, but at a point the game gets slightly repetitive. So I started thinking, what if obstacles were left behind on the screen as you picked up the fruit? What if the screen got perpetually smaller? What if the fruit would try to avoid your snake, or if your snake would start jumping around the screen? These thoughts led me to create a version of snake, which (as of now) contains ten different gametypes, all slightly varied. Click <a href = "snake" target = "_blank"> here </a> to play!
